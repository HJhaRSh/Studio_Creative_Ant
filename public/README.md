# Public Assets

Place your static assets in this directory.

## Image Placeholders

The website currently uses placeholder image paths. To add actual images:

1. **Project Images**: Upload to Supabase storage bucket `projects` and reference in database
2. **Team Photos**: Upload to Supabase storage bucket `team` and reference in database
3. **Award Images**: Upload to Supabase storage bucket `awards` and reference in database

## Image Recommendations

- **Format**: JPEG, PNG, or WebP
- **Project Cover Images**: Recommended size 1200x900px (4:3 aspect ratio)
- **Team Photos**: Recommended size 800x800px (1:1 aspect ratio)
- **Gallery Images**: Recommended size 1920x1080px (16:9 aspect ratio) or larger

## Temporary Placeholders

For development, you can add placeholder images here:
- `placeholder-project.jpg` - For project cover images
- `placeholder-team.jpg` - For team member photos

These will be used until Supabase integration is complete.
